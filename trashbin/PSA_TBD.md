It’s that time of year again. This time the PSA is a little bigger, and not
exclusively about this blog, so bear with me for a bit.

Avid readers of this blog will know that I’m a fan of spirits, especially
whisk(e)y. So big is my enthusiasm for a good dram that I blogged about spirits
around here occasionally. In an effort to keep tech and drink separate and
joining forces with my equally enthusiastic wife I therefore move these blog
posts over to our new joint blog, [Fur and Flippers](furandflippe.rs)! You
can expect reviews of whiskies, books, and distillery visits there, and the
odd recipe to pair your glass of fine liquid with. We’re pretty excited about
it, and hope you’ll be, too!
