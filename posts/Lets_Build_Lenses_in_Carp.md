Today I want to try something a little bit different: I want to share a
screencast with you! I’ve never done this, but I’ve always had a passion for
live coding during my talks<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, and I don’t feel like
writing much at the moment.

The intended audience either knows a little bit about Carp or about lenses
already. This talk assumes no prior knowledge, but it’s hard to learn multiple
concepts at once. Of course you are welcome to watch it anyway, and I’d be
happy to answer any and all questions you might have.

The video file is rather large, and I apologize for that. If you have any
favorite screen recording tools on OS X, please tell me!

   by **Matthew Pickering et al.**: this is great if you want to learn the real
   theory behind lenses and prisms, and optics in general. It is not great if
   you don’t want to read 50 pages about that topic.
2. [Lenses embody Products, Prisms embody Sums](https://blog.jle.im/entry/lenses-products-prisms-sums.html)
   by **Justin Le**: this blog post is a very detailed and deep dive into
   lenses and prisms, using Haskell as the vehicle. It explains why our
   implementation is theoretically unsound and how to rectify that. It is also
   more advanced than my screencast.
