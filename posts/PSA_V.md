It is time for a new installment of my beloved PSAs! This time I’ll quickly
tell you about a nice new way of keeping track of my writings: a Twitter bot.

Although not a Twitter user myself, I realize that a very small percentage of
my users actually uses the RSS feed. A pretty good amount of people who read
my blog either come through the [Recurse Centers](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=3f214b4d8605308d27685ebd4548905e)
internal blog aggregator or various postings and links on the web. A small
amount of my closest friends even receive pesky private messages on some
platform or other so that they'll feel guilty for not keeping track of my
outbursts.

In an effort to create yet another avenue of discoverability, I wrote a few
lines to integrate a [Twitter bot](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/blob/master/rsser/rsser.py#L12)
into my [RSS feed generator](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/tree/master/rsser).
It was a tiny amount of work and the fans of social networking among my readers
get to follow me in a more convenient way if they so desire, so I declare it
a win!

This is all I have for today! Follow my bot on Twitter—or don’t, I’m not a cop.
