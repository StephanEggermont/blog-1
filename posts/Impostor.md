I had a lovely dinner with a few fellow Recursers yesterday. During our
conversation, we talked about “guessers”—i.e. people who only ask for
something when they think they will most likely get it—versus askers—people
who, when they are unsure, will just ask for it and see what happens. Someone
then promptly asked what the others thought they were and we made a little
circle, everyone asking someone else what the other person thought they were.
To my surprise, no feelings were hurt.

I'm a guesser, I've been told, but with an asterisk. “You're a guesser, but you
know you're good”. I wasn't sure what that meant, but it stroked my vanity, and
in lack of a better response I just said that. And then I thought about how not
too long ago I would've vehemently fought against that statement, and we talked
about impostor syndrome, and how to overcome self-deprecation.

I want to share my thoughts here as well. A fair warning: I talk about myself a
lot.

## A story of a boy who couldn't

After repeatedly chiming in to the chorus of self-deprecation I learned that
that hurt other people's feelings. It turns out that, if people regard you as
higher in some intellectual hierarchy—hierarchies are as stupid as they are
pervasive—and hear your self-deprecation, they mostly react in one of two ways:

1. They realize “smart” people have these feelings too, and maybe that makes
   them worry less.
2. They go into full panic mode, because if “smart” people think they're dumb,
   what does this make them?

After learning that the second reaction was a thing I stopped openly
self-deprecating. Of course I never implied that anyone else around me was
stupid, but I definitely see how that sentiment can be inferred.

Naturally that didn't change the underlying feeling. It just stopped me
from perpetuating the same old truisms about myself. But it also led me on a
journey to reflect about who I was and who I am.

I had no background in Computer Science prior to my studies. This was in stark
contrast to most of my fellow students, who had varying degrees of exposure to
programming before going to university. I _really_ was the stupid one in the
room. Instead of letting this get to me, though, I openly acknowledged it and
tried hard to overcome this. And, with equal parts sleep-deprivation and luck,
I managed to bridge that gap and succeed at my studies<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.

But my mindset didn't change for large swaths of my studies. I still thought
of myself as a bad programmer. In some ways that was good, because it compelled
me to work harder. In other ways it was bad: mental health, self-worth, social
life—the small things, you know. I also knew that I was not worthy to study
with the others, and I learned about impostor syndrome after I'd overcome the
worst parts of it.

When I stopped self-deprecating, I reflected on how I'd changed and how anyone
could sincerely regard me as intellectually superior, and for the first time
realized that I had made tremendous progress. It helped me cast myself in a
different light and acknowledge positive thoughts about who I am.

## Taking others seriously

But taking others' opinions of myself at face value required effort. After all,
maybe they just haven't seen me struggle enough. Maybe I've only shown them my
succeeding side, and hidden that pile of garbage that is the other half of me?

Then a thought hit me: if people I respect talked about someone else in the
same way they talked about me, what would I think of them? If a former
colleague walked up to me and said “I know this person. They are nice, and a
really good programmer”, I would probably want to meet them. I wouldn't ask
about their emotional backyard first. Sure, maybe they fooled my friend and
are really just an impostor, but I think my friends are really smart and
generally hard to fool.

If I discount my friend's opinion about me, I discount my friend's opinion in
general. And I know better than that.

This still feels like a mental card trick, but it's good enough to fool me most
of the time. It gets easier and easier to just accept compliments, smile about
them, and treasure them, instead of thinking or saying I don't deserve them.

## 'twas but another rant

It is hard to talk about myself, and this blog post definitely feels too
positive. I'm wary of positive emotions, and even more wary of overtly
displaying them. But this feels important.

Impostor syndrome and self-deprecation are incredibly common in the tech
community. Everyone is different and has different ways to cope with feelings
of not-belonging, and I feel like we all should share our personal collections
of tools.

I invite you to think about how you deal with these feelings, if you have
them. Do you have special tools that others might profit from? Even if they
sound stupid. Most of what I've detailed in this blog post feels stupid to me,
but that doesn't mean it really is. Chances are that what you have to say is
valuable and I would like to hear it. If you'd like to talk, you know where
to find me.

##### Footnotes
<span id="1">1.</span> I know there is some parallel universe where I try
exactly as hard and, due to no fault of my own, fail. I've seen it happen to
others, and it's important to keep in mind. It might not feel like it, but
if you succeed at anything ever, luck was on your side.
