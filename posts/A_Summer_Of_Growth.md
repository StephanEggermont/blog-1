Many of you know that I have applied for a spot at [the Recurse Center](https://recurse.com)
this summer. For those of you who don't, let me give you a brief outline of what it is:
it's a retreat for programmers, meaning that you spend a certain, predefined
amount of time there (usually six or twelve weeks) to work on something that interests
you, possibly with other people. I of course want to take this opportunity to make zepto
a better language.

Well, after two interviews and writing a little interpreter for them, I was admitted.
Yay me! That means I will be in New York for twelve weeks and miss all of you a great
deal. It also means that I currently feel like dancing through this grey January-in-Berlin-morning.
I am excited.
