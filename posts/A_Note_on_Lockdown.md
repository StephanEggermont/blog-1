As most of you will know, a lot of Europe is currently under lockdown, partly
voluntarily, partly state-imposed. This is due to [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019),
a novel SARS-like virus.

All of us are currently battling on many different fronts. Some of us are
struggling to maintain social distance when they work in customer service. Some
of us have to figure out what to do with their children when the daycare
closes. Some of us have to learn how to cope with being alone at home.

Because all of this is happening, I wanted to make sure that all of my friends,
acquaintences, and everyone else in my tiny readership know: if you need
someone to talk to, to drink a beer with remotely, or to just chat with briefly
to fight away anxieties and loneliness, I’m here. I have a wide variety of
interests, I like to talk about almost anything, and I’m happy to just sit and
listen.

Stay safe, stay calm, stay healthy<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
