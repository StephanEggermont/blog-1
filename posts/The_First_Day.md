The first day. Breathe. You made it. Everyone is nice. You've found potential
pairing partners. You did not make a complete ass of yourself, hopefully.

Next time you'll remember to bring a sweater. And you'll come earlier, because
the subway is incredibly crowded. Or should you come later? You'll figure
everything out.

You got two nice books you plan to read, “Pearls of Functional Algorithm
Design” and “Modern Compiler Implementation in C”. Both of them seem incredibly
insightful, they will be fun. Breathe.

Thank you, Jeff, Nick, Dave, Saul, Trent, Da Hua, Rudi, Abe, Mark, Sabelo,
Ethan, James, Parthiv, Alokh, Ben, Michael, Andrea, Iain, Alistair, Sean, and
anyone who I failed to list. You made this day wonderful, and I am happy to have
met you. And now I need some sleep.

See you tomorrow, folks!
