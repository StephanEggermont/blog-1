This post is just meant as a quick update for everyone who follows this blog.
Sorry I've been so inactive lately, I was really busy preparing for the Recurse
Center. This meant finalizing all of the cooperations with my clients—handovers,
meetings, evaluations, etc.—, seeing all of my friends before I leave—I think
the last two weeks have been more dense in dates than any time in my life—, and
the usual packing and organizing.

Now I'm in Williamsburg. I'm staying at Hewes Street on broadway, meaning I'm
almost in Bushwick and I'm hearing the subway constantly, but I'm extremely
happy. I've only been here since Friday, but I've been productive, seen a lot of
the area, and bonded with my new roommates, so I couldn't be more

Anyway, I'm looking forward to starting the Recurse Center tomorrow, because the
introductions of my fellow recursers were amazing and inspiring and I'm really
stoked to meet them. To all of y'all at home, I love you and I miss you. You're
the best. To a great three months!
