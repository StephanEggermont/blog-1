Today is a hot, slow day, so I'll get up on my soap box to share
a little gem with you: the debut album of Puerto Rican Band ÌFÉ—a
brainchild of Mark Underwood, also known as DJ Nature—, titled
“IIII+IIII”. A hipster album name if I've ever seen one. But I
quite enjoy the record, so what the heck.

Don't be fooled by the first song, though, not all the material on the
album is so radical and unconpromising. Some of the songs are actually
a little bland, but the rhythm is infallible and often a bit
spicier than what you might find in other projects; delicious spring
soul food to wake up your tired limbs.

And with that I wish you a great sunny day, wherever you may be.
