Since October, I’ve been working at [feenk](https://feenk.com) as a “DX
crafter”—DX standing for “Developer Experience”. That means that I build tools,
and help people and companies reason about their assets and themselves.

But mostly I just have a grand old time working on GT, the Glamorous Toolkit,
which is one of the most exciting pieces of technology I know of.

And that’s also why I haven’t talked about this so publicly earlier—I wanted to
at least record a demo of it to make sure everyone understands why I switched
gears a little bit.

So here it is. It’s unscripted and not the most flashy, but maybe it’ll give
you a glimpse of why I’m excited about the Toolkit.

PS: if the Git workflow at the end seems a little unrefined still, that’s
entirely because of me! I’m working on it!
