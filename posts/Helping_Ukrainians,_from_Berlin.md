In case you’ve been avoiding the news or don’t live in the Global North: there
is a war going on right now. A war started by Russia by invading Ukraine, a
sovereign nation. There are a multitude of political and historical reasons for
why this is happening, but aggression remains just that.

Since the war started, my family and I have been involved in helping Ukrainians
from Berlin, and I wanted to document what I know about and my experiences, in
the hopes that it can do a little good and help a few people get involved.

Because I do not know how to write gracefully about political and divisive
topics, the tone of this blog post might be different from what you know if
you’re a long-time reader.

I split this post in two parts: donating (financial, material, time), and
hosting.

## Donating

None of these are exhaustive. This is meant as a quick overview of the things
we did or know about.

### Monetary

Monetary help is always needed. If you can afford to spend a few bucks, then I
suggest you go down that route first: it’s immediate and it’s easy.

Depending on your sensibilities, you can donate to unpolitical or political
charities. If it fits your sensibilities, you can even donate to the Ukrainian
military directly. I haven’t done that. I personally donated to the [Anarchist
Black Cross Dresden](https://abcdd.org/en/2022/03/02/donation-page-for-solidarity-with-anarchist-and-anti-authoritarian-activist-from-ukraine/).
As the name suggests, this is a political organization and might not fit your
sensibilities, in which case you’ll have to do your own research.

### Material

Material donations are also appreciated. We’ve donated clothes (though most
places do not accept regular clothes anymore), a laptop, and a stroller.

[The Polish Institute Berlin](https://instytutpolski.pl/berlin/2022/02/28/sammlung-von-sachspenden-fur-gefluchtete-aus-der-ukraine-hilfefurdieukraine-pomagamukrainie/)
is one of a few places that accept every-day items (some places are looking
for items such as combat tourniquets or bullet-proof vests, which I don’t
suppose most of us have lying around). Scroll down for the English version.

[Holzmarkt in Berlin](https://www.holzmarkt.com/) is housing Ukrainian
refugees, and they’re looking both for material donations and people who know
Ukrainian to help coordinate. This is where our stroller and laptop went, and
the person we are currently hosting (see below) is helping out there.

### Time

At the moment, I am working full-time while my wife is on maternity leave. As
such, I’ve been trying to take care of child-care in my off-time to help my wife
free up time to help arrivals at Hauptbahnhof and other places. When we were
most active, these were organized primarily through WhatsApp and Telegram
groups, though I think it “professionalized” over time. [One potential starting
point if you’re interested could be here](https://linktr.ee/michelledts).

We’ve also been helping the people we’re hosting figure out how and where to
get vaccinated, showed them the city, and are currently helping them get their
paperwork in order so that they can start a “new life” here if they decide to
do so. All of this is draining, because bureaucracy is hard, but it’s also
deeply rewarding.

Finally, when you are hosting someone, expect to spend some time just being
there, listening to stories and concerns, and maybe see a troubling image—or
many of them—on a phone screen.

## Hosting

The first time my wife went to the train station to help out she came back with
four kind Moroccan students who had just fled and were lucky enough to come
through before the great racial segregation at the borders started. We hadn’t
planned on hosting that many people, but everyone just took in mothers and
children, and the four of them were “left over”—this might be telling already.

Inviting four strange men into your home might seem scary at first, but I’d
like you to consider that they’re refugees, fleeing from war, trying to figure
out where to go. They have better things to do than a random burglary.

The four of them stayed with us for two nights while we helped them figure out
where they wanted to go next, and who would receive them there. This meant
joining a local Telegram group in another city and writing a message explaining
their situation and asking for housing—really no skin off our backs.

As of now, we are hosting a Ukrainian who wants to stay in Berlin, and we’ve
helped him get his booster vaccination (easy, go to any place that does COVID
vaccinations) and tried to give him a safe space to arrive. Now he’s helping
out himself. We don’t know how long he will stay with us—we’re happy to have
him with us, and our baby has already decided that he’s his new best friend.

## Fin

When the war in Ukraine started I primarily felt two things: grief and inertia.
This war is clearly not about me, and yet I felt compelled to do something. To
come to grips with this, I decided to help where I was, and however I could.

For some of us, getting active like this is giving energy. For some of us, it’s
draining energy. Only give however much you have to give, and don’t burn
yourself out. But please, at least get started.

UPDATE: an important thing to mention is that my wife is way more active than I
am, and for most of the organizing, planning, and executing the credit goes to
her. It’s a deeply troubling situation when the woman in the relationship takes
care of most of the emotional and care work, and I want to at least acknowledge
that. I hope that I succeed in at least pulling my weight.
