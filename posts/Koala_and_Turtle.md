If you’re a regular to my blog, you might have stumbled over my small stories
of a turtle and a koala. In an effort to make this blog a bit more topical, I
decided to give them their own cozy corner [here](/koala-and-turtle). They are
protected from the weather there, not to worry!

I will still link to the posts in my feed and on the front page, but if you are
just coming to maybe smile a little about shelled and furry shenanigans, then
the link above is what you’re looking for!

I hope you stay dry and warm until my next blog post, unless that’s not your
thing, then nevermind.
