This blog post is meant as a quick one to tide you over the ever longer periods
between blog posts.

On January 8th, I gave a talk entitled “Programming Languages and Trust” at
Datengarten. Datengarten is a monthly talk event hosted by the Chaos Computer
Club Berlin. I was fortunate enough to speak before a crowd of extremely bright
people about two topics I cannot claim to be an expert in: programming languages
and their trust level.

It was both livestreamed and recorded, and the result can be seen in its full
glory here.
