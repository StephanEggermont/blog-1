On the 2nd of May, 2021, my first child was born. My wife was a freaking star.
She is, undeoubtedly, the strongest most impressive person I’ll ever meet. I
don’t know that I can describe the whole thing, and I don’t know that I want
to.

The bottom line is that for one month, I won’t be available at all. I’ll be at
home, taking care of my family, and not look at my computer. And I won’t be
available for work for another month, even though you’ll be able to reach me.
I have one more blog post written that I want to edit and get out the door, but
then there will be radio silence.

See you soon, and don’t forget me while I’m gone!
