It's time for sharing music again. Interestingly I only feel like writing about
music when it's something I normally wouldn't enjoy but still find intriguing.
Let's see if that trend continues.

So, today I want to share Tash Sultana with you. She seems new to the spotlight,
but an experienced musician, though I cannot say for sure. All I know is that her
[Tiny Desk](http://www.npr.org/2017/04/06/522848880/tash-sultana-tiny-desk-concert)
performance blew me away. She is so energetic and beautifully excited by her own
music that I simply cannot look away, wich is quite unusual for me. I normally
let Tiny Desk concerts run in the background, becuase they're often very mellow
and calming. Not this time.

I didn't know her music before watching this performance. I'm glad that changed,
and I hope I will see much more of her in the future.

Also, that last song is just _insane_ guitar work.
