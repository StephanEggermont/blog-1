Last week I learned that you can [adopt a Unicode character](https://home.unicode.org/adopt-a-character/about-adopt-a-character/).
Of course, I had to adopt the Koala emoji (at the bronze level), for I am [a
well-known fan](https://blog.veitheller.de/koala-and-turtle/).

I even got a badge!

Sometimes itâ€™s fun to just do silly things.
