I’ve got great news for all of you: [EnthusiastiCon](https://blog.veitheller.de/Enthusiasticon.html)
is back in 2019! [The website](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/) is looking
sharper than ever and [the CFP](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/cfp/) is open for
another two weeks, what more can you ask for?

But before we get ahead of ourselves, a few bits of information for those of you
that don’t know EnthusiastiCon yet: EnthusiastiCon is a two-day, single-track
conference in Berlin. Its core idea is based on [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/),
which means that talks will only be around 10 minutes long, and about a topic
that really excites the speaker. We’ve had talks about topics as diverse as
spreadsheets, type systems, LED clothing, machine learning, and self care!

Thanks as always to our sponsors, [Port Zero](https://port-zero.com) and [the
Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), and to our hosts,
[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) and [Co-Up](http://co-up.de/)!

See you there!
