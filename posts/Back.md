Turtle frowned. His already wrinkly face got even more scrunched up. “Do I
really have  to?” He looked at the Tiny One’s flipper paws bouncing happily in
front of him, his chubby butt sat comfortably in Koala’s pouch.

Koala took his flipper and squeezed it. “You’ll still be here, and we will be
here. You’ll just do other things for a part of your day.”

“Ionwana”, Turtle grumbled. Koala’s ears wiggled confusedly, she didn’t quite
understand. “I don’t wanna”, said Turtle, a little louder, kicking at a rock
with his flipper.

Suddenly, the Tiny One squawked and smiled at him. Turtle’s frown fought for a
second, then it broke up. “You’re right, Tuala. You’re always right. It will be
okay.”
