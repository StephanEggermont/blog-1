I'm not very good with a paintbrush, so I made a bot that paints
for me. It's called [shinupaint](https://twitter.com/shinupaint)
and updates every 10 minutes while I'm online. It's still a little
buggy, but it produces relatively pretty results. You can find
the source code [on Github](https://github.com/hellerve/shinu).

A bit of background: shinupaint (or 死ぬ, which is Japanese for
"to die") started out with me fiddling around with [snek](https://github.com/inconvergent/snek),
a system for producing generative art in Common Lisp. The project
is in its infancy and there is little documentation, so I took one
of the examples and started from there. It is still very much
inspired by the original product, made by the infallible
[inconvergent](http://inconvergent.net/).

I quite enjoyed playing around with snek and hope to find my
way back into the generative art world. I've always just dabbled
and never really deeply understood what I was doing, but it's
always been tremendous fun.

I hope you enjoy the paintings as much as I do. See you soon!
