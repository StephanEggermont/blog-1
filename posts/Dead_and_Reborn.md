I have abandoned my blog for a long time. This might be due to
my sub par writing skills in English, a lack of time or—most
likely—a mixture of both. I would like to change that, though,
and I hope I will with this new format. It also means that I had
to move from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), which was never my thing
to begin with, to a more DIY platform.

This blog solely consists of static pages that I write in markdown
and then convert to `html`, not unlike [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) would do it.
This tool, however, is written in [zepto](https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto),
my own concoction. The source is available [on Github](https://github.com/hellerve/blog).

That's it for today! Have a pleasant start into 2017 and be sure
to check back every once in a while.
