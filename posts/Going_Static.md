I have been doing a lot of web development in the past three years.
I am a backend-centric fullstack developer, which means that if you
hold me at gunpoint I can probably come up with a website that doesn't
suck, but I would be much more comfortable building your API.

Nonetheless, I have been working with with a few brilliant frontend
developers who greatly influenced the way I look at the Web. In
hindsight, I did everything wrong when my website first launched a few
years back. That is a blatant overstatement, of course, but my convictions
have changed dramatically and I cannot help but look back at it with contempt.
All of the personal websites I've built lately—[click](http://malongi.com)
[us](http://veitheller.de) for examples—have been much more minimalistic
than what I would have built a few years ago. I deliberately exclude corporate
websites, because they are very different in terms of what they should look
and feel like. I would like to explore why my views have changed and how I
approach building these websites, both with and without a backend.

## A caveat & an introduction

I alluded to it earlier: I am not a frontend developer. While I have worked
in web development in at least some capacity for most of my professional life,
I am not especially productive when confronted with stylesheets. I have a good
grasp on JavaScript and have used [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
and [Angular](https://angular.io/) to build pretty large web applications in
minimal time. Styling those websites, however, takes ages if you let me do it.

This is especially true in a corporate context. And I don't think that it is
because I have no taste or don't know CSS. The problem runs deeper. I have come
to believe that I have a hard time thinking in a corporate design box.

Kindly regard anything that follows as a description of what pleases my eyes
and, quite possibly, my eyes only.

## I against the world

*I.* I embrace minimalism. It caters to my artistic and æsthetic principles. I
don't mean bogus minimalism à la [material design](https://material.io/guidelines/),
which try to invent a visual language that is both appealing and works in
a corporate context. In fact I think every effort to make anything corporate
look good are doomed. I don't think it is impossible a priori, but I do think
it is hard—especially so if it has to fulfill a purpose (think Customer Resource
Management software or sales portals).

*II.* I believe minimalism and function are naturally at odds. Professional life
is always about selling things, in one or another. Thus, it has to serve a purpose,
it has to fulfill its function. Thus, looking back at the first sentence of this
paragraph, we can conclude that minimalism and professional life are at odds.

*III.* I need to earn money. I like to do so doing things that please me. In the
beginning of my career I was intimidated by the websites of people who were good
at what they were doing. That was especially true if they built software, just as
I aspired to do. I did the natural thing. I copied their style. Most of these
websites were made by talented people and still, they looked bad. In hindsight
it is obvious that my website was also destined to look bad.

*IV.* I have gained a lot of experience since then, working on all sorts of projects,
trying to make the best of things, good and bad. Now I can follow my own æsthetic
intuition.

## How I build websites

When working on projects for myself or people who do not pay me to work I take
my time. I have come to think that that is key to me being able to build a website
I don't completely despise. That is especially true because my resources for
work that is not my domain are expertise are somewhat limited. Of course there
are good and bad days at work as well, but if I have less of an idea of what I am
doing, those good days really are my only hope. The variance is just bigger.

I like static, small, and fast pages, best without a backend. I prefer if I don't have
to optimize, minify, audit, double-audit, harden the database, or, God forbid, build
a fully-fledged development pipeline using my current development tools of choice—at
the moment [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [foremux](http://github.com/mhannig/foremux).
There is something in the air if it is just me, Vim, and the browser. Some of
my personal projects do require a backend. Some are only backends. If that is true,
I try to tackle these problems separately, tricking myself into thinking these
are in fact two separate, unrelated projects. Otherwise, both of them get tainted,
because the backend would often like the frontend to change and vice versa. Most
of the time, especially in small projects, it is better not to bend under the pressure,
and to find a way to deal with an unconforming party gracefully, not unlike in
a conversation. I find that makes both components prettier, if you don't give into
the desire to find hacky workarounds—and if the other party is not objectively
at fault. Once again, that is a wholly personal take on the adaptability of components
in a system. If you disagree you probably have great reasons.

## What to make of this

I am not really sure what to make of all of this. I am still in the process of finding
out what I want my work to be and I am unsure whether I will ever have a definite answer.
I do, however, have a firm grasp on what I currently think and why I think so. And, in
my eyes, that is much more important.
