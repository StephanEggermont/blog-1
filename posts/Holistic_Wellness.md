Today I found out that one of my fellow Recursers makes music. No, that's not
entirely true: today I found out he makes _awesome_ music. He performs under
the moniker [Holistic Wellness](https://holisticwellness.bandcamp.com/album/what-time-does-the-shock-arrive-at-the-top-of-the-pipe),
and his last work is a three-song serving called “What Time Does the Shock
Arrive at the Top of the Pipe?”. This wordy and beautiful piece of sonic
deconstruction sneaked up on me, and I loved every second of it. The first
song, “Melt Glass”, is a home-made concoction, while the other two songs are
covers.

So, without further ado, here's Abe aka Holistic Wellness performing “What Time
Does the Shock Arrive at the Top of the Pipe?”. Props if you know where he might
derive this monster of a title from.
