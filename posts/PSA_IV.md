Every once in a while I get messages about my blog posts. As I don't have
comments enabled on my blog, most of these messages come by e-mail. While this
is perfectly acceptable and prudent, I'd like to share and alternative way to
communicate with me today: Github issues!

This blog is [entirely open source](https://github.com/hellerve/blog), and I've
[talked](http://blog.veitheller.de/Dead_and_Reborn.html)
[about](http://blog.veitheller.de/Going_Static.html)
[the](http://blog.veitheller.de/Reclaiming_My_Writing.html)
[tech](http://blog.veitheller.de/PSA_II.html) before. I keep some of my
longer-term ideas in my head by filing Github issues tagged as `reminder`.

If you want me to write about something or check if it's on my radar already,
I'd suggest you look at the [list of issues](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/issues/)
or [file one yourself](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/issues/new).
