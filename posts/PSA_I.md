From now on my blog posts will contain the publish date for your pleasure.
I hope that this improves your reading experience! The date is in the US
format, though, which undoubitably will alienate some of you. I don't like
it myself, but somehow decided it made sense.

I am currently also considering adding an RSS feed. I might work on that
during the weekend if I find the time; I will write up another PSA once
I've finished it.
