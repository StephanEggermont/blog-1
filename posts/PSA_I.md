From now on my blog posts will contain the publication date for your pleasure.
I hope this improves your reading experience! The date is in the US
format, though, which will undoubtedly alienate some. I don't like
it myself, but somehow decided it made sense.

I am also currently considering adding an RSS feed. I might work on that
over the weekend if I find the time; I'll write up another PSA once
I've finished it.
