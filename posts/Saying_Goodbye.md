Today I attended my great-grandmother’s wake. We weren’t particularly
close, not in the last few years at least. I was there because I thought it is
important to show that the time we did spend together meant something to me,
and I’d like to think that it meant something to her as well.

It’s weird to see people you’ve never met cry at your relative’s wake. It makes
you feel like you ought to know them, and that’s probably true. The faces of
cousins once-removed, great-aunts, people who are vaguely related to you wash
over you as you struggle to remember names, or why they know yours, and you
feel guilty for not spending more time with your family, guilty for moving so
far away, guilty for never visiting.

My great grandmother lived to be 98, and she was mentally present until the
very end. The last three years of her life she spent at a nursing home as
doing household chores became ever more difficult. Apparently my
great-grandmother and the pastor met at a nursing home service, at least that’s
what the pastor said in her eulogy. She said a bunch of things that were not
quite accurate when she recounted my great grandmother’s life, and I wouldn’t be
surprised if she only mentioned that to create an emotional connection.

The pastor tells the congregation how much my great-grandmother enjoyed
visits from her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She lists my name with
all the others’. I cringe. The last time I saw her was three years ago, shortly
before she moved into the nursing home. I feel like a bad relative again, and I
am, at least by the standards of the rural community I come from. You don’t move
so damn far away, and if you do, you come to visit. The only moment where I have
to wrestle with tears is when the pastor says my name, and that my
great-grandmother loved seeing me so much.

I have a cold, but I haven’t had a coughing fit all day. Of course as soon
as the pastor speaks, tells everyone about my deceased relative, recounting
the important moments of her life as if she was reading from a history book,
talking about a Great Person, my throat starts to itch. Soon I fight the
urge to cough until my eyes feel like they might pop and my throat wants
to explode. I finally give in: I cough, I cough again, and then again.
It doesn’t stop until the sermon is over, until the organ starts playing, until
it doesn’t matter anymore. Isn’t it always like that?

I didn’t even know she was religious. On paper everyone is Christian here,
but few actually go to church. I wonder if she always did, or if it was one of
the things she found in the nursing home. I wouldn’t know. I never visited.
Never.

All of us could be better, as lovers, friends, relatives, as people. It’s okay
to feel guilty. It’s not okay to let my guilt tell me how to live my life, not
when it’s unreasonable.

I’ll have time to talk to her now, to remember her, to sit down with my memory
of her, and to let her speak to me until my heart is full. I don’t know whether
I’m speaking to her or to myself, and I suppose I’ll never find out, and in the
end maybe it doesn’t matter.
