Hey! How are y’all doing? We haven’t talked in a while!

As you might have realized my posts haven’t been as frequent as usual. I want
to talk about why that is, and why it won’t change for a while.

First off, I have great news! In two weeks, on the 13th of April, I’m marrying
my lover and my best friend. This is one of the main reasons for my silence. As
is customary, the size of the party spiraled out of control and now we have way
more guests than we expected to have (around 50). This made organizing the day
a little more challenging than we anticipated.

And of course, a great many things happened. I’m finishing up a project for a
client of ours—it’s due one day before the wedding—, and, because I’m a
terrible planner, I [helped organize Enthusiasticon](http://blog.veitheller.de/Enthusiasticon.html)
and submitted a talk proposal. In a stroke of ~~bad~~~good luck, the talk got
accepted, and I had to work on that as well. I gave a talk about Carp, and you
can look at the slides [here](https://github.com/hellerve/carp-intro).

Anyway, back to the important bits. I’m getting married, and then we’re going on
a honeymoon trip to Iceland and Scotland. I’m not going to write anything during
that period. I’ll miss you, but I’ll be back, I promise.

See you soon, and if you’d like you can drink a glass or mug of your favorite
beverage for us on April 13th, and it will almost be as if we clinked glasses!
