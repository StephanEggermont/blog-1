“What did you say it is called?”, said the turtle, its tiny head poking out of
the hole, “I find its rather pleasant to sit in indeed.”

“It's a pouch”, the Koala answered, “I usually only let my kids in, but you
can stay for as long as you want.”

The turtle retracted its head, closed its eyes, and rested its flippers on the
soft warmth of the grey fur. “You know what”, it whispered, “I just might.”.
