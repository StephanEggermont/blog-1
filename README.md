# blog

The articles on my personal blog and the tools that power them.

This repository includes a [dead-simple static site generator](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/blob/master/publish.zp)
written in zepto, a [distraction-free WYSIWYG Markdown editor](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/tree/master/blargl)
written in Elm, and a [RSS-feed generator (from `index.html`)](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/tree/master/rsser).
The generators are tailored to my specific needs, but the Markdown
editor could be useful for more people. [See it in action here](http://blog.veitheller.de/blargl).
