Let me start off this blog post with a movie recommendation: “Arrival” is a great movie. If you haven't already I suggest you watch it. I myself was a bit late for the party and only saw it last weekend, and I'm glad I did. The music, shots, and story are all worth seeing even if you end up not liking the movie. It is cinematographically interesting and challenging, and that alone is worth a bit less than two hours of your time, I'd say.

The main protagonist of the movie, Louise, ends up writing a book entitled “The Universal Language”, which is what I want to talk about, more or less. I've been thinking a lot the last few weeks, mostly about what is fundamental in programming. I'm not even close to having an answer to the deceivingly—as we know, [simple ain't easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)—questions, but I'd like to share my progress.
