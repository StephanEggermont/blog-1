As some of you might know, I recently got enamoured with a new programming
language, Carp. While you might have caught me fawning over it already, in this
post I want to give you a little introduction into the language and its
concepts and maybe you’ll understand why I decided to work on it. A little word
of caution before we begin, though: the language is in a pre-alpha stage and is
thus subject to change. The syntax and APIs I’m about to show you might change
in the future and my post might become obsolete. It won’t be the last time
you’ll hear me talk about Carp anyway.
