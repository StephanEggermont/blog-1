Today is the birthday of this blog. Exactly one year ago I wrote [my first
post](//blog.veitheller.de/Dead_and_Reborn.html); in it I briefly wrote
about my fear of being unable to write in a foreign language, abandoning this
blog as quickly as I did with my last, Ghost-based solution.

Now, 365 days and approximately 65,000 words laters, I know that my fears were
understandable but unfounded. I feel comfortable with my setup and my writing,
even through [occasional
mishaps](//blog.veitheller.de/Postmortem:_Corrupting_RSS_And_Twitter.html) and
inexplicably popular posts that drive my anxiousness levels to the maximum.
I am happy you are here, together with approximately 4700 other IPs per month.
I am grateful for my audience, a group of people that is open for non-technical
and technical posts, occasional whining and a lot of weirdly detailed posts
about tiny projects noone really cares about.

I also am quite surprised that people have never complained about the homebrew
monstrosity that is this blog. Either I’m doing something right—which I refuse
to believe, since this is technology and we’re all doomed—, or you’re all much
better about being nice to crappy websites than I am.

A special thank you goes out to the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com)
and [CCC](https://ccc.de/) communities, from which I draw a large part of my
most faithful readers. Thanks goes also to [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), who was surprisingly friendly to my posts
when they ended up there, and the
[r/programminglanguages](https://reddit.com/r/programminglanguages) community,
who has been putting up with a lot of my Carp rants lately.

Thank you for this past year. It has been a wild ride.
