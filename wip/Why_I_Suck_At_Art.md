I listened to [John Cleese’s Google talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-p44-9S4O0)
a while ago. There are a whole lot of profound ideas in there, but the most
important thought for me personally comes up around 45 minutes in, during
the Q&A session. I want to talk about anxiety and why I suck at art, and in
the process misrepresent Mr. Cleese’s point.

As you might or might not know, I sometimes dabble [in generative
art](https://veitheller.de/art) and [poetry](https://veitheller.de/poems).
I also play the guitar, although not that often anymore. I objectively am
not very good at any of them<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. It doesn’t
matter, though, because it is purely recreational, and I enjoy it.

But sometimes I do wonder why my art isn’t very good, and I get anxious
when I look at other people’s portfolios. I have no right to do that,
though, because, as I wrote above, my artistic dabblings are supposed to
be for recreation. This obviously doesn’t work, because I like to be good
at the things I do, but I’d like to write about that at length some other
time.

What matters is that I end up feeling anxious. And to counter that I often
double down, and program an artwork or write a poem. The results are
unequivocally terrible, and not unexpectedly so.

Anxiety can be a good motivator, but not for the creative process. If I
want to get stuff done in a field where I don’t have to be creative—write
a program I’ve mostly written before, for instance—, that’s perfectly
fine, though of course not ideal. When working creatively, on the other
hand, anxiety corners you. You get something mediocre, something you’ve
done before. Your mind flows through the path of least resistance.

But even when starting from a more healthy place, say creative hunger that
possesses you during a long relaxed weekend, I will find a way to make
myself feel anxious. I will think about all of the people I admire, but
couldn’t possibly ever compare to. I will think about the peace of mind
with which I assume they approached the artworks that I look up to, and how
simple it was for these masters to create them<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. 
And I will feel a crippling angst that holds my creative mind hostage.

However, in some cases anxiety can be channeled into art. Truly masterful
comedians can even make people laugh at their dread. But: it won’t ever
guide you into a space your mind has never been in before, and you won’t
have any revolutionary ideas. I say that as if it was a fact, but of course
it is mere opinion. More talented, more hardworking, and more accomplished
creatives might feel differently about this. Even John Cleese himself
doesn’t seem to be entirely unconflicted about this, as seen in [this
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL0dmBy5qTw) at around 42
minutes in, and in his book<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.

I know, however, what works for me and what doesn’t. And feeling anxious,
although it is ever present in my life, doesn’t work for me.

#### Footnotes

<span id="1">1.</span> I’d like to point out that I’m not fishing for
                       compliments here. I know my art very intimately, and
                       I know that it doesn’t work in a variety of ways.
                       And sometimes a little gem comes along.

<span id="2">2.</span> That’s another one of these little lies that anxiety
                       tells us. There is not a single revered creative
                       I’ve ever heard of who wasn’t always full of
                       existential dread about their work. It is a kind of
                       fuel, but channeling it is hard.

<span id="3">3.</span> I think he makes a distinction between extrinsic and
                       intrinsic anxiety, but that would completely
                       devastate my point, and so I will gloss over it.
                       Didn’t I tell you I wanted to misrepresent his
                       argument?
