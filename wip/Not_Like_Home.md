Koala and turtle looked around in awe. The forest was lush and green, and the
leaves swayed gently in the wind. "It's beautiful here", sighed koala, and her
ears wiggled a bit.

Turtle smiled for a while. Then he sniffed, and he sniffed again. "It doesn't
smell like home", he said with a tiny bit of melancholy.

Koala frowned. But between her big ears she was thinking very hard. All of a
sudden she smiled again, and moved her face very close to that of turtle. With
her paw gently resting under turtle's nose, she said: "and now?"

Turtle sniffed, and he sniffed again. He could smell koala, and he knew every
bit of that smell. "Now it smells like home."
