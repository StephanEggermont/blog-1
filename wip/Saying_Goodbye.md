Today I attended the wake of my great grandmother. We weren’t particularly
close, not in the last few years at least. I was there because I thought it is
important to show that the time we did spend together meant something to me,
and I’d like to think that it meant something to her as well.

It’s weird to see people you’ve never met cry at your relative’s wake. It makes
you feel like you ought to know them, and you probably should. The faces of
cousins once-removed, great-aunts, people who are vaguely related to you wash
over you as you struggle to remember names, or why they know yours, and you
feel guilty for not spending more time with your family, guilty for moving so
far away, guilty for never visiting.

My great grandmother lived to be 98, and she was mentally present until the
very end. The last three years of her life she spent at a nursing home as
doing the chores got ever harder, understandably so. Apparently the pastor
and her met at the nursing home mass, at least she said so. She said a bunch
of things that were not quite accurate when she recounted my great
grandmother’s life, though, and I wouldn’t be surprised if she only said that
to create an emotional connection.

The pastor tells the congregation how much my great grandmother enjoyed the
visits by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She mentions my name,
along with all the others. I cringe. The last time I saw her was three years
ago, shortly before she moved into the nursing home. I feel like a bad
relative again, and I am, at least by the standards of the rural community I
come from. You don’t move so damn far away, and if you do, you come to visit.
The only moment that I have to wrestle with tears is when the pastor says my
name, and that my great-grandmother loved seeing me so much.

You have a cold, but you haven’t had a coughing fit all day. Of course as soon
as the pastor speaks, tells everyone about your deceased relative, recounting
the important moments of her life as if she was reading from a history book,
talking about a Great Person, your throat starts to itch. Soon you fight the
urge to cough until your eyes feel like they might pop and your throat wants
to explode. You finally give in, you cough, you cough again, and then again.
It doesn’t stop until the sermon is over, until the organ starts playing, until
it doesn’t matter anymore. Isn’t it always like that?

I didn’t even know she was religious. On paper everyone is a Christian here,
but few actually go to church. I wonder if she always did, or if it was one of
the things she found in the nursing home. I wouldn’t know. I never visited.
Never, never, never.

All of us could be better, as lovers, friends, relatives, as people. The
relationships with my family are mine to shape, and I won’t let my guilt tell
me how to live my life, not when it’s unreasonable.

I’ll have time to talk to her now, to remember her, to sit down with my memory
of her, and to let her speak to me until my heart is full. I don’t know whether
I’m speaking to her or to myself, and I suppose I’ll never find out, and in the
end maybe it doesn’t matter.
