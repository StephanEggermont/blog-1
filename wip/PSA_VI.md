I’m pleased to announce that I introduced HTTPS to my blog today! From now on
you can read my blog posts through the comfort of a secure connection, powered
by [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). I didn’t deploy it any sooner
because [I really don’t have to use HTTPS](http://n-gate.com/software/2017/07/12/0/),
seeing as my blog doesn’t have any interactive content. It’s all just static
diatribes of yours truly, no strings attached.

But of course I have some security-minded folks in my inner friend circle
who’ve been wanting to read my blog through HTTPS, and as it really isn’t that
much work to set it up—and, because of Let’s Encrypt, also free—I decided to
give the people what they want.

Anyway, I won’t force you to use HTTPS in the future and the HTTP version will
still remain online, so there is something for everyone.

I also have two blog posts about Carp in the pipeline, so stay tuned!
