I'm in the US at the moment. Not for a very long time—thanks
to the Recurse Center not even for the longest time this year—,
but for a long enough time to get pensive. My English isn't great.
For those of you who have heard me speak or for those who see my
writing it might not be as apparent, but for me it is. It's pretty
good under normal circumstances, even if I do say so myself, but
whenever I get stressed it suddenly falls apart. Standing in line
at the TSA my hearing suddenly gets bad, my voice gets weak, and my
throat won't produce a sound.
