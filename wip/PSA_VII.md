In this installament of my famous series of PSAs I want to announce that I’ll be
talking about Carp for a little more than half an hour in New York City on the
23rd of October! The talk is organized by the [Recurse
Center](https://recurse.com) and is part of their [Localhost talk
series](https://www.recurse.com/localhost). I’m honored to be part of the
illustrous group of people who have spoken there!

You can [RSVP](https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-veit-heller) right now
if you’d like to see me and are in the area! Sadly, the talk will not recorded,
but I expect that I’ll be talking about Carp more than anyone cares for in the
coming future.

If you’d like a little bit more information before RSVPing, you can also [read
