I always imagined my first published paper to be the work of many hours of hard
Computer Science research into the wee hours of the night, compiled into a piece
of writing of stellar quality. Of course life got in the way, and instead my
first published paper will be published in the proceedings of [SIGBOVIK
2019](https://sigbovik.org), ... It’s four pages long, its title is “Eventually
Consistent Partying”, and it applies distributed systems research to drinking
alcohol at parties. As per usual, you can find it on [my Github](http://github.com/hellerve/eventually-consistent-partying).

All things considered I think life turned out to be better than my imagination.
