In the summer of 2016, I flew to Bilbao to attend EuroPython. I was [still
working](/zepto,_A_Eulogy.html) on [zepto](https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto),
and used some of my downtime to mull over some of the concepts that I wanted to
put in the language, or had already implemented. I told a lot of people about
it, too, and many seemed very interested in it, if only for all the ideas that
I had.

Naturally, I eventually started to think about how I could get some of the
concepts into Python in the hopes that people would then have an easier time
understanding what they meant. Most of the features seemed impossible to graft
onto the language without touching the interpreter itself, which would make it
both tedious to implement and for the curious to build.

Then I thought of one of my favorite talks at the time, in which [David Beazley
talks about metaprogramming in Python for three hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiWg5jSoZI).
