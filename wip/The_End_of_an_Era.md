I passed my Bachelor's examination yesterday. That concludes a few very busy days filled with anxieties. As I've detailed [previously](http://blog.veitheller.de/A_Summer_Of_Growth.html), I also had to undergo the Recurse Center interviews this weekend, an equally draining experience. Everyone assured me I would be fine, but anxiety does not bow to rational thinking. Yes, it was highly probable I would pass. Yes, there was no possibility for the presentation or the thesis to change my GPA—or rather, the German equivalent of the GPA. But that, too, doesn't challenge the rule of all-encompassing, sweating, cold-heat-inducing dread.

But I'm done. I did pretty well in the end, even. My GPA is somewhere around `3.14`—`1.86` in German grades, and, because we don't usually are as granular, that is rounded off to `2.0`. I am okay with that. I actually got almost perfect grades for my thesis and perfect grades for the presentation, with the worst grades being very close to the start of my studies, when I wasn't as motivated.

All in all, I am happy. This final test concluded a part of my life that I am happy to let go, even though it was one of the happier parts of my life until now. I am ready to look for new challenges, without baggage.
