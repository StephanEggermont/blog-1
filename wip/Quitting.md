I've felt it's important to address something. I'm not feeling like being a
software engineer anymore, and I know people are going to ask questions. I
don't want to answer them in person, and so I'm going to answer them in a
blog post and hope that I'm addressing all of the questions y'all might have.

I can't talk about this topic without being emotional; excuse any overt
outbreaks while I detail why a big part of my life has suddenly stopped being
that.

While I'll probably sound a little harsh towards the Recurse Center, I'm
actually grateful. They're one of the healthier, more sustainable US hacker
communities I've experienced and the only blame I want to shift on them is
that they've made me realize that I don't want to be what I currently am,
which is hardly their fault.

## The haunting presence

In the last few years I've spent a lot of time wondering why my workplace was
shit. In hindsight, some of them were certainly shit, but maybe there was more
to it. If I can't pinpoint the reason, maybe I'm lacking introspectionâ€”or
refuse to see it?

I switched jobs a lot, because I was bored often. I still am.
