This is a blog post about [a cute hack I threw together on a long train
ride](https://github.com/hellerve/compfuck). The gist of it is that I wrote a
Brainfuck compiler that emits Carp code, in Carp. It’s entirely based on macros
and dynamic functions, meaning that it executes at compile time. Basically, you
have a compiler running inside another compiler.

The techniques I used to build this are not super advanced, but people seemed
interested in knowing how it works, so I decided to write a little tutorial
about it. You’ll learn a little bit about Brainfuck, a little bit about Carp,
a little bit about macros, and a little bit about compilers—or so I hope.

Let’s get this party started!
