This post will be fairly quick, just a shout-out to a project I've been
fond of for quite some time.

Some of you might know [Radio4000](http://radio4000.com/), a website for
Youtube-based radio players. I've had a mostly abandoned radio there for
quite some time now and quite enjoy the site. They now introduced an
embeddable version of the radio player. Here's mine:

<radio4000-player slug="artisanal-cheeseburgers"></radio4000-player>
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/Internet4000/radio4000-player-vue/master/dist/radio4000-player.min.js" async=""></script>

It's really easy to embed. The nice folks at [internet4000](https://internet4000.com/)
built [a website](https://embed.radio4000.com/) that lets you create an
embeddable player pretty easily. They really did a great job on that front,
but that shouldn't surprise anyone who is familiar with their work.

Have fun!
