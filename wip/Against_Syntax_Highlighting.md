I've been asked to add syntax highlighting to this blog by friends and peers a few times now. I didn't listen to them, though, and that's not because I don't value their contribution. I thought about syntax highlighting in blog posts for some time and then decided it was doing more harm than good. Let me explain.

## Why syntax highlighting is good

Syntax highlighting has obvious advantages. It reduces the cognitive load of the programmer by preparsing the source and annotating the source with colours. Color-coding individual parts of the source is helpful for skimming and scanning source code, as it provides a crutch for the imperfections of perception.

Syntax highlighting is especially helpful for beginners. If you don't know what tokens mean you can infer it from the color of the highlighting engine, making you memorize less, which in my opinion is a good thing.

I use syntax highlighting when reading and writing code.
