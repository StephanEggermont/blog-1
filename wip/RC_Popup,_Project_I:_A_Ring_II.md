This post is going to be quite short, just a little update on the ring project
I talked about [yesterday](http://blog.veitheller.de/RC_Popup,_Project_I:_A_Ring.html)
and a quick note on some other tinkerings. I’ve not been able to make much
headway today, because I still get a lot of e-mails after my blog post on
[Carp](http://blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html) was on Hackernews and r/programming.
I enjoy these messages, but they do take a toll on my productivity at the
moment.

I changed the torus form to be more ring-like, i.e. a band form. Now I’m
experimenting with different thicknesses and sizes, and for that I had to
change the rendering from lines to curved vertices, which was fun, but didn’t
feel very productive.

I then updated my [art site](http://veitheller.de/art/) with some small
projects, and prepared the next blog post on Carp, which will hopefully clear
up some confusions that people had reading the first installment. I plan on
getting it done by the end of this week. Similarly, the ring will hopefully
be ready to be 3D printed in a few days, so I can actually see what it looks
like in the real world and know whether I’ve painted myself into a corner.

I will keep you posted!
