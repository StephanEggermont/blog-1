As a few of you know, I’m co-organizing [Enthusiasticon](http://enthusiasticon.de/)
this year. If you don’t know already, however, this blog post is for you.

Enthusiasticon is a small conference happening on March 31st in Berlin, and
it’s free! The basic idea is that the speakers are talking for a maximum of ten
minutes about a topic that excites them—or should I say “makes them
enthusiastic”? The [CFP](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/cfp/) is still open for
another week; sorry for not telling you sooner. We’d be delighted to receive
your proposals!

Our keynote speaker, Rachel Uwa from the [School of Machines, Making, And
Make-Believe](http://schoolofma.org/), will tell us about what makes her
excited, and deliver a little call to action. I’m especially excited about this
part; I got to know Rachel briefly when I attended the [RC
Popup](https://www.recurse.com/blog/123-rc-pop-up-two-weeks-of-collaboration-and-focused-work-on-generative-art)
in Berlin—[see also](//blog.veitheller.de/RC_Popup,_Project_I:_A_Ring.html)—,
and found her to be an incredibly welcoming person with interesting ideas, and
I want to hear more of that.

We’ve also created a [newsletter](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/#keep-me-posted)
for you to subscribe to if you want to stay in the loop.

Lastly, I want to thank our sponsors. My ever-gracious employer [Port
Zero](https://port-zero.com/) has been kind enough to help us out, and so has
the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), who I’m sure you’re familiar
with if you’re reading this blog—if not, check the bottom of the page!

I’d be thrilled to see you there!
