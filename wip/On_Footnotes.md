I’m a huge fan of footnotes, both in print and on the web. I use them all the
time on this blog, and I have a ton of opinions about how to do them right,
though I don’t think I’ve ever spoken about them, let alone justified them.
This blog post intends to do just that.

I’m not a professional writer, typesetter, or designer, though, and while I do
think that I’m okay at stringing words together, I don’t intend to present this
as anything more than my own private opinions. If you have great points that
speak for or against anything I say in this post, please reach out!
