“I don’t understand.” Turtle shook his head slowly. “You’re telling me you keep
creature facts in your head?”

Koala smiled. “Not creature facts per se”, she intoned, “things about them. Like
when they were born, so I can congratulate them on that, or little tidbits about
their family and friends, and where they lived and what they’ve done.”

“But how is this useful?”, said Turtle, trying hard to understand.“I like to
keep facts in my head myself, facts that are useful in itself, like what tree
bears fruit when, and at what time of the year I need to find shelter.”

“That’s great! But I’m not very good at holding onto these kinds of things, and
they’re not that important to me.” Koala paused for a moment to scratch her
nose.“You know, when I learn something new about another being, it feels like a
little flower. I put it in my pouch, and I keep it there, waiting for the right
time to give it back. I like when others remember things about me, and so I
think they do too. And so I can hand them the flower, to brighten their day a
little.”

“Hum, maybe that is useful”, mumbled Turtle. “Let me try, then: when is your
brithday again?”

Koala giggled. “Today!”
