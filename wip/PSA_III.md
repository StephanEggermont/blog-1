A new PSA! We didn't do these in quite some time! How fun!

In this third installment I just want to tell you that I added two new
subsites to my website, now linked to from my homepage. The first one is [a
website for my latest exploits in computer-generated art](https://veitheller.de/art),
which I've now shown quite a lot of people already, but might be of interest
anyway. Most of the happened in the last week, and I'm pretty excited to share
it.

The other I'm not quite so sure about. It's [a website for my
poems](https://veitheller.de/poems). Most of them are written in German—except
the poems in [felt](https://veitheller.de/poems/felt.html)—, and I'm not sure
whether I like them, but I've been writing for years and years, and a lot of
people from my home town actually know some of my older work, as I've annoyed
everyone through public appearances all through my flamboyant adolescence.

Now I'm less full of myself, and, as a result, less sure of my poems.
But I will put them out there anyway, hoping they will not lead to outright
dismissal.

That's all I have to say this time.
