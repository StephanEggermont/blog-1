In [one of my previous blog posts](http://blog.veitheller.de/Reading_%E2%80%94_The_First_Month.html)
I told the tale of how I came back to reading after a long period of literary
hibernation. I also hinted at revisiting the theme when new trends emerged,
and since this month has brought change to my reading I thought an update
might be in order. There are people who can present raw numbers in a format
that is not mindnumbingly boring, but I'm not one of them, so consider
yourself warned. I will throw around a few numbers that might not at all
interest you.

# Give me the data

First of all I've started reading prose and poetry books again. I've yet to
finish one of these books—both of them are rather long—but I've progressing
steadily and I hope to include these books in my “done” list sometime next
month.

As for things that I've actually finished, I've read a lot of scientific
papers again, all of them filed under “Computer Science”. It's 15 papers
again, totalling 368 pages of PDF or 13.14 pages a day. This presents a
growth rate of approximately 73.6% in pages, which is not bad at all. Even
more interesting is the growth rate in pages per day however, since February
is three days shorter than January, meaning that I read 6.3 pages more per
day, representing a growth rate of 92.1%. Following that logic, I almost
doubled my reading! I have another metric up my sleeve, though. In my previous
post I also talked about pages read per working day, so let's apply that
metric as well. I've worked 20 days in February—all of the weekdays—, which
is two days less than in January, where my page count was at 9.64 per working
day. This month, this is up to 18.4 pages a day, marking 90.8% growth. Not
quite as impressive as the raw pages per day, but still a pretty clear uptick.

| Metric            | January | February | Growth Rate |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Papers            | 15      | 15       | 0%          |
| Total Pages       | 212     | 368      | 73.6%       |
| Pages p. day      | 6.84    | 13.14    | 92.1%       |
| Pages p. work day | 9.64    | 18.4     | 90.8%       |

# Now what?

After giving you the raw numbers like your employer might in an annual
review—meaning you consider faking a coughing fit just to get out of there—I
will now try to make sense of these numbers. First, the good news: I feel like
my reading quality has increased, meaning that I have a clearer opinion about
what I read and feel like I can better express it. This might be due to me
reading more papers that are within my comfort zone, but, reviewing what I've
read, I doubt this explanation. I will not try to come up with one that feels
more correct, though, because I do not think I can objectively judge any of this
anyway.

I also have bad news, though: I doubt I can maintain that growth. I would hope
that the quantity of my reading stabilizes and try to avoid seeing this as some
sort of perverse competition with my past self, as this will undoubtedly take a
toll on the quality of my reading. Instead, I will focus on finding a healthy
saddle point in the curve that's comfortable for me both in quality and quantity.
I don't want to see my reading list as a burden but rather a healthy incentive to
read more and better.

My conclusion is thus the same as last time: I will notify you if anything significant
happens and in the meantime let's all just assume that this project is now tagged
as a stable release—sorry for the lame pun, but I couldn't think of a better analogy.
See you soon!

P.S.: I also added table styling just to make the table in this post a bit more palatable.
