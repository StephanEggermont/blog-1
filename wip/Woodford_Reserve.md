As a few of my readeers might know, I recently finished my batch at the
[Recurse Center](http://recurse.com/). I’m currently on my flight back from
the States. Because of a delayed flight, I found myself in a duty-free shop
earlier, and I decided to buy my frustration away. Naturally, my eyes were
mesmerized by the—emberassingly small—liquor shelves. After toying with the
idea of buying a young bottle of Royal Salute—young in this case means their
youngest edition, which is 21 years old—I settled for a bottle of one of my
go-to bourbons, [Woodford Reserve](https://www.woodfordreserve.com/) Double
Oaked, for reasons of price and availability.

Let me tell you a little bit about Woodford Reserve, because I like their
products a lot and I visited their distillery last March, on the same trip
during which I visited the [Jeptha Creed](http://jepthacreed.com/) distillery,
an experience about which [I blogged before](http://blog.veitheller.de/Jeptha_Creed,_or:_How_I_Learned_to_Love_Vodka.html).

## Damn old, yet so new

The distillery of Woodford stands on one of the oldest distilling sites in
Kentucky—Bourbon distillation started in 1780. One of the more interesting
historical tidbits on the Whiskey is that [Dr. James Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._James_C._Crow)
of sour mash fame worked there in the early 19th century. The history is
very palpable when visiting: all of the buildings, from the actual
distillery to the warehouses and bottling plant, are actually pretty old.
The site is charmingly pretty, even if it feels pretty manicured.

The interesting part about the Whiskey from this distillery then is that it
doesn’t *taste* old, despite all of the heritage. It is a fresh-tasting spirit
with a distinctly unique taste and feel. Of course the explanation for this is
as simple as the explanation for why most of Bourbon production is currently in
a weird place: Bourbon fell from consumers' grace for most of the second half of
the 20th century, and production stopped in 1971. Only in the 90’s did the same
corporation that abandoned the product repurchase the property and start anew.

## A spirit of horses and farms
