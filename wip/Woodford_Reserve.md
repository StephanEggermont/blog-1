As a few of my readers might know, I recently finished my batch at the
[Recurse Center](http://recurse.com/). I’m currently on my flight back from
the States. Because of a delayed flight, I found myself in a duty-free shop
earlier, and I decided to buy my frustration away. Naturally, my eyes were
mesmerized by the—emberassingly small—liquor shelves. After toying with the
idea of buying a young bottle of Royal Salute—young in this case means their
youngest edition, which is 21 years old—I settled for a bottle of one of my
go-to bourbons, [Woodford Reserve](https://www.woodfordreserve.com/) Double
Oaked, for reasons of price and availability.

Let me tell you a little bit about Woodford Reserve, because I like their
products a lot and I visited their distillery last March, on the same trip
during which I visited the [Jeptha Creed](http://jepthacreed.com/) distillery,
an experience about which [I blogged before](http://blog.veitheller.de/Jeptha_Creed,_or:_How_I_Learned_to_Love_Vodka.html).

## Damn old, yet so new

The distillery of Woodford stands on one of the oldest distilling sites in
Kentucky—bourbon distillation started in 1780. One of the more interesting
historical tidbits on the Whiskey is that [Dr. James Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._James_C._Crow)
of sour mash—and, sadly, “Old Crow”—fame worked there in the early 19th
century. The history is very palpable when visiting: all of the buildings, from
the actual distillery to the warehouses and bottling plant, are actually pretty
old. The site is charmingly pretty, even if it feels pretty manicured.

The interesting part about the Whiskey from this distillery then is that it
doesn’t *taste* old, despite all of the heritage. It is a fresh-tasting spirit
with a distinctly unique taste and feel. Of course the explanation for this is
as simple as the explanation for why most of bourbon production is currently in
a weird place: bourbon fell from consumers' grace for most of the second half of
the 20th century, and production stopped in 1971. Only in the 90’s did the same
corporation that abandoned the product repurchase the property and start anew.

## A spirit of horses and farms

I came to Woodford through my partner, who is much well versed in the world of
bourbon than I am.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> I never bought into the—mostly
uninformed—snobbery that surrounds whiskey in Europe, especially the “old
guard” parts that scoff at bourbon without having tried it. But it’s somewhat
hard to find Germans who are excited about bourbon, especially people my age,
so it took a US-American for me to really get into it.

Woodford Reserve was among the first ones that I sampled, and I immediately
fell in love. It’s now the bourbon I serve friends and family who claim not to
like bourbon, and it turns out a lot of them actually enjoy it. It’s a sweet
and rich bourbon, with a lot of caramel and toffee, so that might help—but
let’s not get ahead of ourselves with the tasting notes.

Let’s talk about the distillery itself. Brown-Forman really goes all in with
the craft aspect of the drink, starting with the distillery: a beautiful
estate by a river, with old production facilities. The tour sends you through
the still house—seen in Figure 2—, a gorgeous old stone warehouse, and to the
bottling line. Woodford Thoroughbreds is about half a mile away, and you can
practically feel the horses’ presence while sauntering from one historically
rich facility to the next.

While I quite enjoyed seeing the production line, it all looks uncannily
pretty. This is not uncommon for distilleries that offer tours—it’s a
marketing thing, after all—, but Woodford’s facilities are lavish even compared
to the other beauties in the area. This, of course, is no coincidence: as I
alluded to earlier, this is a ploy by Brown-Forman: they needed to create a
spirit that was able to compete with Maker’s Mark, one of the first craft
bourbons that “made it”.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>  This isn’t meant to
discount the spirit’s quality—it’s a superb piece of craftmanship—, but it’s
an interesting lens through which you can view one of Kentucky’s finest
liquid products. At which point I should probably introduce you to the real
thing.

## Tasting notes

I will only talk about the Double and Double Double Oaked varieties here,
because it’s been some time since I’ve had Distiller’s Select and I can’t
recall the finer notes well enough to describe them anymore.

  bottles and a branded Glencairn at home. Deal with it.

The Double Oaked variety was aged in two different bourbon barrels, finishing
the regular Distiller’s Select in a new deeply toasted barrel for another year.
Double Double Oaked repeats this process one more time. This leads to a dark
and rich spirit.

### Color

First, the color. Double Oaked looks like a mix of copper and amber, very much
on the dark side of the bourbon continuum. Naturally, Double Double Oaked
one-ups its younger companion, with a deep brown color that almost looks as if
the wood itself had liquified, sloshing in the glass heavily.

### Nose

The nose doesn’t break the promise the color made: rich caramel and toffee
notes, but a surprising wealth of fruits as well, some of them a little
synthetic—remember those hard, round bubble gums that tasted like nothing but
artificial flavoring? I do, and the Double Oaked is making sure I never forget.
There is a lot of oak in there as well, which should come as no surprise—though
it isn’t overpowering at any point. A little syrupy and a hint of vanilla.

The Double Double Oaked, however, has a stronger wood profile, with a little
burnt caramel and more syrup.

### Taste/Palate

The Double Oaked variety is thick and rich, with oak, vanilla, and caramel
being the most dominant players. More subtle, but still present, are leather,
grapes, and tobacco. Vanilla, caramel, and oak make for a sweet and pleasant
combo that makes me want to sit by the fire and read stories to my children.
Now I only need children.

Contrastingly, the Double Double Oaked makes for a less pleasant experience.
With its even greater viscosity and dominant oak notes it is relatively banal,
but stays with you a long time. This bourbon is living proof of a higher age
not always leading to a better whiskey.

### Finish

We get a little bit of allspice, the toffee and caramel turn a little burnt,
and the vanilla and leather join forces to stick to your tastebuds, sealing
the deal with our Double Oaked. There is a whole lot going on with the fruit
notes as well, but I feel like that can only be tasted, not described—at least
yours truly is lacking the words here. All the way at the end a tiny bit of
banana gets us by surprise.

The finish of the Double Double Oaked comes as a little bit of a relief.
Although there still is an undisputable amount of oak in there, we now also
have some raisins, caramel, and leather, making the whole experience a bit more
interesting, if not worth the price tag.

## Bottom line

Woodford Reserve is an interesting distillery to visit and to sample. While I
personally do not enjoy some of their creations—the Double Double Oaked can
only very seldom be found in my liquor cabinet—, their standard offerings are
quite good as sippers. Their Master’s Collection line is also always promising,
although to be frank I’ve only sampled one of them. If you want a solid and
affordable bourbon experience, get a bottle of Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
and enjoy the wealth in taste and texture.
