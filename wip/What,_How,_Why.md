I don't know how many people read my blog. Sometimes that's a bit frustrating,
because I don't know which posts people like and why, but I've come to realize
that that's a good thing; I'm not driven by metrics, but my own wandering
thoughts alone. That's what I wanted my blog to be, anyway: a collection of
thoughts I deemed important enough to write down.
[This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/how-the-like-button-ruined-the-internet/519795/)
on the Google Reader solidified my convictions on what this blog should be
enough for me to write this post on the what, how, and why of the inner workings
of my little corner of the web.

## People are frightening

Every now and then I look at the server logs, just to see how many requests come
in. All of my pages are fairly lightweight, and load is not much of a problem,
but checking logs every now and then is, in my experience, good practice. I've
seen my traffic grow tremendously since registering my RSS feed in the
[Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) blog aggregator. People I don't know read
this blog, and that's frightening, somehow, but I guess that's what I signed up
for. Not having analytics saves me from constantly being frightened by how many
people read my ramblings.

The same argument is applicable to comments. I like discussion, but I'm not sure
I like any comment platform. [Disqus](https://disqus.com) is detrimental for
everything I want this blog to stand for. It's neither simple, nor small, nor
pretty. And rarely have I seen substantial discussions conducted through the
medium; I certainly don't think it's impossible, I just think that's not how
it's used. I could roll my own comment widget, I'm sure, but again, why bother?
I'm sorry if I seem like I'm avoiding conversation, but that's partly because
human beings are the most frightening thing to roam the known universe and
partly because I'm lazy.

## Bad habits

Sometimes good inventions encourage bad habits. Syntax highlighting is a great
invention. It helps me read code by giving me semantic cues, especially when
skimming. Sometimes it even helps me find bugs, like parenthese gone astray
without me needing to compile or run the program. It's especially helpful for
beginners, I feel, because highlighting groups of things in different
colors—having one for, say, primitive data type literals and one for
keywords—helps novices find structure in the chaos that is programming.

In a blog setting, however, it just encourages writers to sling walls of code at
their unsuspecting readers. I specifically chose not to use syntax highlighting
with say, [Prism](http://prismjs.com/) or [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/),
because I would be tempted to do the same. By not having syntax highlighting, I
restrict myself to not showing my readers more than ~8 lines of code at a time.
I've been asked a few times to add syntax highlighting by friends and colleagues.
Sorry, folks, but that just won't happen. I don't want to speak to y'all in code.

## Delusions of grandeur

All of this makes it sound as if I think I got this blogging thing down, when,
in fact, I don't. I started this blog a mere three months ago, on a whim,
without giving it much thought. But I am an avid reader of blogs, both
professionally and in my free time, and I failed to keep a blog twice in the
past. Now, for the first time, it feels like I'm onto something sustainable. And
I want to share the product of this process with you while be transparent why
and how I get there. Maybe my ideals change, and if they do I'll share them with
you again; let me wish you all the best in the meantime!
