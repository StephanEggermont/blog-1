Koala rubbed her nose. She sneezed. She rubbed her nose again. “What _is_
that?”, she exclaimed confusedly.

“That’s the first snowflake of the year, and it landed directly on your nose.”,
answered Turtle with a smile on his face. He had seen the flake come down
shortly before Koala had realized what had happened, and her reaction was just
too adorable.

“Humpf”, grumbled Koala, “I don’t think I like it very much. It’s not very
polite.” Then she saw other snowflakes come down, and her eyes widened in
wonder. “What’s this? And that? And that one over there?”

“Those are all snowflakes”, explained Turtle with a big smile on his face. He
enjoyed being able to explain things, especially to this small furry creature.
Her excitement for all the things that had seemed so little before made them
grow big and important.

Koala turned and followed the course of one of the snowflakes down to the
ground. She even bent down to look at it melt on the not quite frozen ground.
“Those are pretty!”, she exlaimed. “We don’t have those where I come from.
Maybe I do like them.”

Now one landed on Turtle’s nose and he shook his head and sneezed. Koala
turned around and, realizing what happened, let out a big laugh. “That’s what
you get for being Mr. Smartypants!”

Turtle pouted for a second, then he smiled. “Do you know what a snowball fight
is, little grey one?”
