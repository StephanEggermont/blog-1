I decided I wanted to read a year ago. I made a [public reading list](https://github.com/hellerve/ptolemy)
and wrote multiple [blog](http://blog.veitheller.de/Reading_%E2%80%94_The_First_Month.html)
[posts](blog.veitheller.de/Reading_—_An_Update.html) about it evaluating my
progress. Now, one year into this experiment, I’ve decided to write about it
again, and see where I’m standing.

Let me get the numbers out of the way before analyzing them. Figure 1 has the
very unscientific findings.

| Category/Metric     | Pages   | Items    | Pages p.d.  | Items p.d. |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Technical Papers    | 1144    | 72       | 3.13        | 0.20       |
| Technical Books     | 1343    | 5        | 3.68        | 0.01       |
| Recreational Papers | 160     | 13       | 0.44        | 0.04       |
| Recreational Books  | 2688    | 15       | 7.36        | 0.04       |
| Total               | 5222    | 104      | 14.31       | 0.28       |

Ive calculated the page and item counts as well as how much reading that is per
day, and I’ve split it up by topic. Technical papers and books are those
pertaining to Computer Science in a broad sense, whereas recreational reading
is anything else. This year’s recreational papers were mostly psychological,
which makes sense considering that I studied that for a year and still have a
lingering interest in the field. This year’s list of recreational books
includes a fair amount of books that I felt i had to revisit, and not very many
new ones.

The bottom line is that the nu,bers are kind of embarassing. The only numbers
that I find acceptable is the numbr of papers I read; the number of technical
papers is acceptable for someone who is not part of academia in any sense of
the word and the number of recreational papers I don’t really care about. Both
technical and non-technical books I need to read more of, though, especially
those meant for recreation.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

On the other hand, the nubers are kind of encouraging: I used to be an avid
reader as a kid, and at one point just stopped, or at least that’s what it felt
like. Quantifying how much I actually read helped me both in getting an insight
into my actual reading habits and, through a perverse form of gamification, led
me to read more. I’m grateful for that, and hope this trend will continue.

There is a lot that’s missing from the Figure 1, as well. I read a lot of
news—between five and fifteen articles on any given day—and a few graphic
novels each year. I also don’t finish every book that I start; there are at
least 5 more technical books that I stopped reading before finishing them this
year, and they’re not on the list. And, lastly, I’ve listened to twenty
audibooks this year, for a total of 245 hours and 52 minutes, which isn’t bad
at all.

Bonus statistic: in 2017, I’ve written 60501 words on this blog. That’s between
127 and 155 book pages, depending on the format and trim size you prefer.

#### Footnotes

about recreation while writing that sentence.
