A question that comes up every once in a while on the Carp chatroom and in
Github issues is how memory management works. People who are not familiar with
Rust especially have understandable trouble grasping how to program with
references, and why some functions take references while others don’t. Today,
I will try to explain these concepts for my fellow Carpenters.

A fair note: while this blog post might be beneficial to your understanding of
the Rust borrow checker, this is not my focus. I don’t know Rust very well, and
it is entirely possible that it does things differently and I’m just confusing
your understanding of how its machinery works. I therefore suggest that you
don’t try to compare the two too much lest you fall prey to faulty assumptions.

## An unfortunate piece of syntax

I have an inkling that at least some of the confusion surrounding references
stems from the obvious comparison to references in more familiar languages such
as C and Go. It’s not only the name that is reminiscent: even the syntax is
identical. Ampersands take a thing by reference, as has always been the case.
Only that the semantics of “taking a thing by reference” are not the same at
all.

In the languages mentioned above, taking a reference has direct implications on
the memory level. In languages with first-class memory access—read C and C++
and other languages that allow for nasty things such as pointer arithmetic—,
taking a reference means that you end up with a pointer, i.e. a number
representing the point in memory where the thing lives. Languages like Go take
a safer subset of that behavior, and allow people to pass things by value or
by reference. Most of you will at least have a basic intuition about some of
this behavior, but if not, you can read my [blog post about these
concepts](http://blog.veitheller.de/References_and_Values.html) which might or
might not make sense.

This is not generally problematic—except for the class of bugs it opens—were it
not for the unfortunate design decision of many borrow-checked languages—Rust
and Carp, at least—to reuse that name and the syntax surrounding it. It is,
albeit, not the same thing at all, and I will henceforth refrain from ever
mentioning it again. Let’s look at Carp, then.

## Who owns what?

The idea surrounding borrow-checked languages is that of ownership and lending.
Capitalist at heart, these languages obsess over the flows of property. This
serves a simple goal: if you know who owns what at any given moment, you also
know when you can get rid of it.

The Carp compiler tries very hard to do as much as possible for you. It inferes
almost any type, the occasional annotation nonwithstanding, for once. And in
the same vein, it tries to make memory management as simple and automatic as
possible.

References are a piece of that puzzle. They are similar to type annotations,
but instead of helping the type checker figure out the types in your program,
it operates on the memory level. It helps let the borrow checker know who you
think should own what. You then engage in a conversation with your compiler,
effectively, working together to build a program with correct memory semantics.

As becomes apparent quite quickly, however, the process is a lot more manual
than type checking. As it turns out, ownership has for a long time been largely
implicit in our programs, and we haven’t spent quite as much time trying to
figure out the underlying theories in this domain as we have for typing.

But let’s get back to the point, shall we?
