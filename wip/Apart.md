"Shnuff", murmured Koala and scratched her nose with her paw. She couldn’t
sleep.

"Shnuff", grumbled Turtle and wiggled his butt.

Koala turned around and reached out with her paw. She touched the ground. She
frowned for a moment. Then she remembered. “I’m not at home”, she thought to
herself, and frowned even more. But then, looking up at the stars in the sky
shining brightly down at her, her face softened again and she stuck her paws
in her pouch to look for the tiny but beautiful life growing within her.
“We’re going to be home soon. And for a while we’re going to know again what
it’s like to miss it.”

On the other side of the world, Turtle retracted deeper into his shell,
dreaming of his fluffy-eared companion. Maybe there was even a smile on his
face.
