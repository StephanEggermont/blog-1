I don’t know how many people are still reading my Turtle and Koala stories.
Those of you who do can rest assured that they will keep coming, though, and
that I have no intention to stop making this blog a friendlier place by writing
about the tiny exploits of my two favorite characters.

Today I want to introduce you to a moore frequently updated alternative to my
[backlog of stories](/koala-and-turtle): my fiancée and I have been sharing
little vignettes of the odd couple for a long time, and she finally found the
time and energy to [put some of hers
online](http://turtle-and-koala.tumblr.com/). Her writing is somewhat different
from mine—objectively better, as I maintain—, and you might enjoy that breath
of fresh air.

Give it a try and do tell us what you think!
