It’s time for another post [in my series on Carp patterns](/carp-patterns).
This time we’re going to be looking at macros, and the dynamic parts of your
code more generally.

There are many different opinions when it comes to macros, when to use them,
and how to organize them. Different Lisp communities have different best
practices, and they all have good reasons for them. While the use of macros is
somewhat discouraged in Clojure, for instance, they are ubiquituous and widely
embraced by the Common Lisp community.

It’s no surprise, therefore, that most of the literature on the craft of macros
comes from the Common Lisp tradition. This is not to say they do not exist in
other Lisps—one of my favorites is actually “Mastering Clojure Macros”. If you
want to read more about this topic, you can check out my reference section
below.

For those of you that don’t know: I also wrote [a series of blog posts on
Scheme macros](https://blog.veitheller.de/scheme-macros).
