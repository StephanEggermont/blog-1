I had a dream in which I wrote. When I woke up, I scribbled it down. I actually
remembered all of it. It felt unreal.

The text wasn’t actually all that great. I want to write about the dream
instead.

I rented a room in a non-descript country. I didn’t speak the language very
well. I think I dreamt in English, except it felt as if I was speaking a
language that’s much more foreign to me. The owner left with two girls; I don’t
know about their relationship. I was alone in the sublet.

The doorbell rings. I open. A man in a suit speaks very fast, i hardly
understand him. He pushes the door open and comes in. Apparently he’s a
building inspector of some sort, but I don’t really get it. He asks me whether
I’m the owner, but doesn’t wait for my response. He talks so fast that I can
hardly say a word.

My landlord comes back. The two talk to each other, not listening to me,
constructing this story of me posing as the owner, when in fact I am nothing
but a lowly subletter. I try to protest, but cannot speak. They leave the room
after they’re done scolding me, and I go back to my bedroom.

I undress—it is very hot—and start to write. Somehow my partner is also there,
but I don’t know how she got there. She just appeared. She is naked as well.
The girls the landlord left with earlier also come in, undress, and get into
the bed. I couldn’t care less, and continue to write until I wake up.
