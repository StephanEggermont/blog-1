Vodka is odor- and flavorless, and it’s made from potatoes. At least that’s
what Smirnoff tried to make us believe when it was bought by Heublein in 1939.
“White Whiskey” without smell or taste was a great marketing strategy for the
time, but it didn’t do justice to the drink. I’m not a big Vodka drinker
myself—I prefer Whiskey and other richer spirits—, and so for a long time I
also believed that it is a sign of good Vodka if it doesn’t taste like
anything. I now know the error of my ways.

As a few of you might know, I visited my partner’s family back in March.
Her immediate family lives in Louisville, KY, right in the heart of Bourbon
country. Of course this was an opportunity to good to pass up, and so we
visited quite a few distilleries. Most of the tours were very enjoyable, and
I got to drink a lot of different spirits of impeccable quality. One of the
highlights, however, was our tour of the [Jeptha Creed](https://www.jepthacreed.com/)
distillery.

Jeptha Creed is a real newcomer, with the distillery opening only a few months
before we arrived. There is a large amount of heritage intertwined with the
new, however, and their signature Bloody Butcher corn has been grown by the
family for over 150 years. I won’t go into the details of their story here
too much, because I’m a) not sure anyone cares, and b) not the right person
to ask anyway.

What I can say, though, is that the distillery is small and familial-feeling,
and the tour guide we had was nice and knowledgeable. With my partner’s
father, her and I being the only tourists he needed to entertain at the time,
the tour felt both entertaining and enlightening.

Of course the best part was the tasting. I’m not sure whether it was because
we were the only ones, but we got to try ten or so of their creations, leaving
me pleasantly buzzed and a little bummed that I couldn’t bring any more
bottles back home.

## Get to the point already

Back to the Vodka. Because the distillery is so young and needs to get their
foot in the door, they currently mostly sell Moonshine and Vodka, with their
Bourbon being sold out a lot and, to my knowledge, only available in Kentucky.
The guide started with a big bottle of their signature Vodka, telling us that
it might not taste like the Vodka we know. Boy, was that an understatement. It
was *actually good*! It had a rich, pleasant taste, a note of corn and a
delightful texture that I don’t really know from clear spirits. I was floored.

Of course, all of their infusions—lemon, blueberry, and all that jazz— were
great as well, but they usually are, especially with a good Vodka. But I had
my mind set on that tall bottle of straight, clear, and humble liquor.

To cut a long story short, next time we visit family I’ll bring a bigger bag.
